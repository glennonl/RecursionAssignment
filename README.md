# RecursionAssignment
This Assignment Recursively Counts Coins and Traverses Files


This assignment relates to our capstone because it is an algorithim assignment and our capstone implements an algorithim, although more complex, to create the schedule. It finds all the possible combinations of change for a given moentary value. Although the method for doing this is different/more complex in ClassySchedule it is the same idea. Also ClassySchedule determines which solution is preferred.
